### Context:
Over the course of a week, I spent around 15-20hrs creating this application. It's the final project for Mod 1 and I enjoyed having more freedom with my CSS styling.

### Contributors:

### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of dry JavaScript and 
event delegation to handle event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops

### Wins + Challenges:
A major win for me was being the sole contributer to this project and having more confidence in my ability to write cohesive CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I ran into a few challenges with some JavaScript functions not behaving as I anticipated, but was able to track down the problems using the debugger feature in DevTools. This also was one of the first opportunities where the CSS styling was more up to our discretion, so I enjoyed exploring animation features and I'm excited to dive into them even more.
